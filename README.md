Police and the effects of Inter

By: Jack Lohman


Project Statement: 

The purpose of this project is to use critic sentiment in combination with film data to create a model capable of predicting Rotten Tomatoes critic scores, also known as the "Tomatometer." 


Motivation:

This project was created for Denison Data Analytics 401 class, taught by Dr. Alexandre Scarcioffolo. Creator Jack Lohman aims to analyze the role of call volume and time to event data in the punitive outcomes of police interactions. Punitive outcomes are defined by an arrest, citation, or filed police report.  

Build Status:

The project, overseen by Dr. Scarcioffolo, is currently in the development stages, and results are not yet considered complete. 


Requirements:

Required hardware includes RStudio version 2024.12.1+563, with the following packages: tidyverse, kableExtra, caret, survival, survminer, lubridate, data.table.


Data File:

As the data file is too large to be added to the repository, it is available upon request. It contains dispatched law enforcement incidents from the city of San Francisco from 2015 onwards, but only the years 2022 to 2025 are used in analysis. 

Code Files:

	Police Overload.rmd:
	The main coding file, used for data cleaning, and statistical analysis.

 
How to Use:

	Police Overload.rmd:
	*Open in RStudio, making sure that source files are in proper directory
	*Import packages in file header
	*Navigate to the "Run" menu and run all to see output
	
		As the current status of the project is incomplete, code and findings in within 		the document should be treated as such.
